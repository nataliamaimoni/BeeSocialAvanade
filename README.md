# Bee Social by Avanade
As a  final paper for the Avanade&Gama Experience, we had to develop a Social Network.

Our group decided to develop a corporate network.
When we received the final projectÂ´s theme, we brainstormed and realised that big corporations have a huge problem nowadays that mainly is that their employees have a hard time communicating and sharing experience.
Therefore, to try to bring the employees together, we have developed Bee Social by Avanade.

Our main goal was to solve day to day problems, like housing, commuting to work, changing experiences and even learning groups.
Let's imagine that a employee from one branch, needs to travel to another branch for a couple of weeks, but he/she has no knowledge of the city they are going to be located at. He/she can try to communicate with people who live in that city and get to know tips on where to stay, where to go, where to eat, etc.
Another scenario would be that people from different projects, that hardly see each other can maybe exchange experiences, problems they are facing and even success cases that could be applied all over the organization.

How does Bee social works?

First of all the new employee needs to be signed up to the system. Once he is registered, he will receive an email with his login details.
When he access the login area for the first time, he is redirected to the Edit Profile page, where he needs to add all his personal information.
After that, he can access his timeline and then see posts from his friends, and the communities he is participating.
There is also an alert space on his timeline for organization alerts or messages.

He have developed the app using Angular.
Also a node framework called Hapi.js and the Mongo Database.
